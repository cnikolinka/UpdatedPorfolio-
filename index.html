                    <p>
                        My name is Nikolina, I grew up in a small town called Pisz, in a lake infested province in
                        Poland.
                        Growing up I had big dreams of becoming a veterinarian one day as I always had a very special
                        place in my heart for animals.
                        My family and I migrated to the states in the Fall of 2003. </p>

                    <p>I had to learn the language, adapt to the new melting-pot cultural differences, and find new
                        peers.
                        After graduating High School I was nowhere near ready to step into the real world, or to decide
                        what I'd like to study in college.
                        My dreams of becoming a veterinarian were no longer possible due to my immigrational-status
                        conflict. </p>

                    <p>I tried my strengths in Dietary Science and then a few years later in Nursing. Life has brought
                        difficulties which forced me to quit school both times.
                        While being away from school and supporting myself with my full-time bartending job I knew I
                        needed to gain an education and start a more serious career path.
                        Learning to code was a brand new idea, a scary as much as an exciting one. </p>

                    <p>signed up for the Rutgers bootcamp diving deep into the unknown.
                        Even though I begin this journey with absolutely no prior experience. I am confident in my
                        ability to learn and persevere. </p>

                My goal was to become a private nutritionist and help others reach their health goals. Understanding
                nutrition, especially nutritional content, can have a remarkable impact on our health. Educating a
                potential client about the benefits of nutrition, and the various ways healthy living can improve our
                well-being, was the focus of the degree.

After creating a new username using the firebase authorization system the user will get placed in a chat with others that are near his/her location. You cannot join a chatroom outside of your geolocation, therefore assuring that eveyone involved is local.
